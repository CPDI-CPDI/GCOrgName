# GCOrgName
Compile most used GC org names to get one harmonized name and ID number. 

At this stage, this project is meant to identify whether it is possible to move to a python script from an excellent, if complicated Excel Power Query set of scripts. 

Sometimes there are names which need to be changed from source data. For example, several entries from the FAA have been changed to better explain what those organizations are. These changes have been made in the 'combine_csvs_to_script_folder.py'
In the FAA, the Offices of the Information and privacy Commissioners are considered the same organization. However they are operated as separate organizations, and that real-world situation is reflected in the official list of GC organizations. This change is created in the 'combine_csvs_to_script_folder.py' script.
