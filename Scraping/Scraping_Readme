The point of this script is to take the official names according to the Financial Administration Act from the FAA website and structure them into a single CSV. 
Schedules 1, i.1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 contain the legal names for GC organizations. Each schedule gets its own CSV file.
All legal names are harmonized into one CSV file, along with the schedule number in which they were found. 
Sometimes leagal names repeat in several schedules. The duplicates were removed.
